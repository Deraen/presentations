; # Typed Clojure, core.typed

; - (an optional) type system for Clojure (and ClojureScript)
;   - ”Typed Clojure preserves Clojure's strengths, enhancing many of
;     them with the safety of static type checking”

; - Heavily influenced by Typed Racket (another Lisp)
; - Created by Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant
;   - +1 year of development paid with crowdfunding
;   - Honours thesis “A Practical Optional Type System for Clojure”
;   - Currently studying at Indiana University
;     - Sam Tobin-Hochstadt (Typed Racket developer)
;     - Daniel P. Friedman (Prof., Little Schemer with Felleisen)
; => So there is some research behind this
