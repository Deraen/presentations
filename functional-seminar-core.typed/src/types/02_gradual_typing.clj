; - Core.typed doesn't change how Clojure is run, still a dynamic language
;   - Functions still have multipler arities, no pattern matching...
; - Type checking is a function
; - Type checking stage before compilation (linting)
;   - Or constantly at editor (Vim, Emacs, Cursive, â€¦)

; - Because Clojure is dynamicly typed, type system has to work
;   together with non-typed code...
; - *Gradual Typing*: To protect interoperability between typed and untyped code
;   - Work is being done so that some type checks would be done at runtime

;         wrapper -^
; - wrapper would do runtime checks to check that the fn
;   is being called as it's type annotated
; - Not implemented on core.typed yet!
